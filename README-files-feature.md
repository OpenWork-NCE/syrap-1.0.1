# Files Feature Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Files feature in the SYRAP application, which allows users to upload, view, download, edit, and delete files.

## API Routes

The following API routes have been implemented to handle file operations:

1. **Get All Files**

   - Endpoint: `GET /api/files`
   - Query Parameters:
     - `page`: Page number for pagination
     - `limit`: Number of items per page
     - `search`: Search term for filtering files
     - `type`: Filter by file type (pdf, word, excel, text, zip, image, or all)
   - Response: List of files with pagination metadata

2. **Get Single File**

   - Endpoint: `GET /api/files/{id}`
   - Response: File details

3. **Delete File**

   - Endpoint: `DELETE /api/files/{id}`
   - Response: Success message

4. **Download File**

   - Endpoint: `GET /api/files/{id}/download`
   - Response: File content with appropriate headers

5. **Upload File**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/fichiers/upload`
   - Request: Multipart form data with:
     - `file`: The file to upload
     - `title`: File title
     - `description`: File description
     - `visibility[]`: Array of visibility options (CENADI, MINESUP, IPES)
   - Response: Uploaded file details

## Components

### FileForm Component

The `FileForm` component is used for both uploading new files and editing existing files. It includes:

- Title and description fields
- File upload field (for new files only)
- Visibility selection (multi-select)
- Form validation
- Loading states
- Success/error notifications

### FileList Component

The `FileList` component displays a list of files with:

- Pagination
- Search functionality
- Filtering by file type
- Sorting options
- Actions for each file (edit, delete, download)
- Loading states
- Empty state handling

### FilesPage Component

The `FilesPage` component integrates the `FileList` and `FileForm` components and handles:

- Data fetching
- State management
- Error handling
- API interactions

## UI/UX Features

The implementation follows Mantine UI best practices:

1. **Consistent Design**

   - Paper components with borders and proper spacing
   - Consistent use of icons from Tabler Icons
   - Light variants for alerts and badges
   - Proper typography hierarchy

2. **User Feedback**

   - Loading indicators
   - Success/error notifications
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Empty state messaging

3. **Accessibility**

   - Tooltips for actions
   - Proper labeling
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management in modals

4. **Performance**
   - Debounced search
   - Pagination for large datasets
   - Optimized API calls

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- API request errors with appropriate messages
- Form validation errors
- Network errors with retry options
- Graceful degradation

## Security

All API routes are protected with bearer token authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access file operations.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. File preview functionality
2. Drag-and-drop upload
3. Bulk operations (delete, download)
4. Advanced filtering options
5. File versioning
6. Access control based on user roles

## Usage

To use the Files feature:

1. Navigate to the Files page in the dashboard
2. Use the search and filter options to find files
3. Click the "Add Document" button to upload a new file
4. Use the action buttons to edit, delete, or download files
